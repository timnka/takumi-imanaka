        description:'As a Full Stack Engineer at DocuSign on the Login Authentication team, I enabled login flows to persist IP-based geolocation data for all user login actions across the entire 1+ billion user base. My work serves to bolster identity security for the 1 billion users at DocuSign by serving as the foundation for subsequent security features, namely Impossible Travel login detection. I developed in React, TypeScript, C#, and the .NET MVC web framework. I drove the service integration of a 3rd party microservice with our login flows that processes 1.5+ million daily login actions, and refactored a React app to safely consume and display the new IP-geolocation data.',
